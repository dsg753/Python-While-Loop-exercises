Python Exercises with while Loops

This repository contains Python exercises that utilize while loops to solve practical problems. Each exercise demonstrates a different application of the while loop, and each code file is documented with inline comments for clarity.

About the while Loop

The while loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains True. It is useful when the number of iterations is unknown or depends on dynamic factors, such as user input.
